At the moment I'm a Project Supervisor in the multi-family construction/renovation industry, however I'm looking for a career change. I'm currently enrolled in The Univerisity of Texas at Austin Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. My goal is to gain as much knowledge as possible while doing this course and use the resources provided to get into the industry. I'm determined to successfully make this my new career in the near future.</p>
